# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a beginner starting my journey in DevOps. Step by step, Iâ€™m learning how to bridge development and operations by exploring tools and practices such as version control, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud environments.

Iâ€™m especially interested in how DevOps helps automate workflows, improve collaboration, and deliver software more efficiently. My goal is to build a solid foundation in the core concepts while gradually moving toward more advanced practices.
